# WebPagesOnUnlock
Python script that allows you to quickly open multiple tabs of webpages you open often. 

This script runs each time I unlock my computer. 
I have added websites that I often visit to it, so that every time I unlock my laptop, I can immediately open the tabs that I check frequently. 
This is my alternative to opening however many tabs and closing them each day. 

Current goals:
1. Clean up the code
